### A 3-player WIP Pong-style game that links a TI-86 Graphing Calculator and a Sony PlayStation 1 through a network. Players 1 and 2 use the PlayStation, while Player 3 can affect the game using the calculator.

To download, run `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aaronjamt/3-Player-Pong`
Otherwise, the PSn00bSDK submodule will not be downloaded and you will get weird errors if you try to run `PSX/SDK/install_psn00bsdk.sh`
